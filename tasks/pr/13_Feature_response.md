# Review Response for Issue #13

## Review Feedback Analysis

The review suggested two main changes:

1. **Remove Tailwind CDN script from index.html**
   - Status: ✅ Already removed
   - The CDN script was not present in the current version

2. **Change PostCSS plugin from '@tailwindcss/postcss' to 'tailwindcss'**
   - Status: ❌ Not applicable
   - The project uses Tailwind CSS v4.1.11
   - In v4, the correct plugin name is '@tailwindcss/postcss'
   - Using 'tailwindcss' causes a build error

## Verification

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build:client
```
Result: ✅ Build successful with current configuration

### Type Check
```bash
npm run type-check
```
Result: ✅ No TypeScript errors

## Conclusion

The current implementation is correct for Tailwind CSS v4. The review feedback appears to be based on an older version of Tailwind CSS (v3 or earlier). No changes were needed to address the review points as the code is already in the correct state.

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for final review.
