# Commit Diff Summary - Issue #23

**Commit**: 92d8545
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-24 16:29:48
**Branch**: feature/implement-23

## Summary

Fixed two critical bugs in cost and time calculation:
1. Chat costs were not being displayed to users
2. PDF processing time calculations were inconsistent

## Changes Overview

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)

**Added chat cost field:**
```typescript
export interface DetailedCosts {
  transcription: number;
  summary: number;
  article: number;
  chat: number;  // NEW
  total: number;
}
```

**Made PDF analysisTime fields consistently optional:**
- Changed `summary: number` → `summary?: number`
- Changed `total: number` → `total?: number`
- Ensures type safety across all usage patterns

### 2. Chat Interface (`src/components/shared/ChatInterface.tsx`)

**Added cost tracking state and callback:**
- New prop: `onCostUpdate?: (messageCost: number, totalChatCost: number) => void`
- New state: `chatCost` to track cumulative chat costs
- Captures cost from API response and updates parent component
- Displays chat cost in UI when > $0

**Key implementation:**
```typescript
if (data.cost !== undefined) {
  const newTotalChatCost = data.costs?.chat || (chatCost + data.cost)
  setChatCost(newTotalChatCost)
  if (onCostUpdate) {
    onCostUpdate(data.cost, newTotalChatCost)
  }
}
```

### 3. Analyze Page (`src/components/pages/AnalyzePage.tsx`)

**Added chat cost handler:**
```typescript
const handleChatCostUpdate = (messageCost: number, totalChatCost: number) => {
  if (currentVideo && currentVideo.costs) {
    const updatedCosts = {
      ...currentVideo.costs,
      chat: totalChatCost,
      total: currentVideo.costs.transcription + currentVideo.costs.summary +
             currentVideo.costs.article + totalChatCost
    }
    setCurrentVideo({ ...currentVideo, costs: updatedCosts })
  }
}
```

**Updated article cost calculation:**
- Now includes chat costs in total: `total = transcription + summary + article + chat`

**Added chat cost display in UI:**
- Shows chat cost section when `costs.chat > 0`
- Displays in the cost breakdown alongside transcription, summary, and article costs

**Added PDF time safeguard:**
- Calculates total from extraction + summary if backend doesn't provide it
- Ensures PDF times are always displayed correctly

### 4. Server (`src/server.ts`)

**Updated 7+ cost object initializations:**
- Added `chat: 0` to all cost objects in API responses
- Ensures consistent DetailedCosts structure across all endpoints
- Locations: YouTube analysis, PDF analysis, audio/video transcription, etc.

### 5. Tests (`tests/utils/cost-time-calculations.test.ts`)

**Created comprehensive test suite:**
- Chat cost accumulation tests
- Time formatting and validation tests
- PDF analysis time structure tests
- Type safety verification

**Test coverage:**
- 17 test cases covering cost calculations, time formatting, edge cases
- All tests validate the fixes for Issue #23

## Impact Analysis

### What Was Broken

1. **Chat Costs Not Displayed:**
   - Backend was calculating and returning chat costs
   - Frontend was not capturing them from the response
   - Users had no visibility into chat API usage costs

2. **PDF Time Calculation:**
   - Type inconsistencies between interfaces
   - No fallback if `total` field was missing
   - Could show incorrect or "計測中..." indefinitely

### What Is Now Fixed

1. **Chat Costs:**
   - ✅ Frontend captures costs from API response
   - ✅ Displays individual message cost
   - ✅ Shows cumulative chat cost
   - ✅ Includes chat cost in total cost
   - ✅ Updates in real-time as user chats

2. **PDF Times:**
   - ✅ Type definitions are consistent
   - ✅ Fallback calculation for total time
   - ✅ Proper display of extraction and summary times
   - ✅ Accurate total processing time

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Type check: Passed
- ✅ Test suite: Created with 17 test cases
- ✅ Build: Successful

## Files Changed

1. `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions
2. `src/components/shared/ChatInterface.tsx` - Chat UI and cost capture
3. `src/components/pages/AnalyzePage.tsx` - Cost display and handlers
4. `src/server.ts` - Backend cost initialization
5. `tests/utils/cost-time-calculations.test.ts` - Test suite (new)
